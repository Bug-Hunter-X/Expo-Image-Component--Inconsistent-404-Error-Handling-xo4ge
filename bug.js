This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that returns a 404 error.  The component doesn't consistently handle the error, sometimes rendering nothing, sometimes crashing, and other times showing a blank placeholder indefinitely.  The issue seems to be related to how Expo manages image loading and error handling, especially when using features like caching.
